## User Story

- **As a** user
- **I would like to** select digits
- **In order to** calculate a sum

### **Management rules**

1. The select contains digits 1-9
2. IF the user has not selected a digit THEN the select shows the option "Select digits"
3. IF the user selects a digit THEN the digit is added to the sum AND the digit is disabled inside the select AND the digit is added as a tag next to the sum
4. IF the user presses a digit tag THEN the digit is removed from the sum AND the digit is not disabled inside the select anymore
